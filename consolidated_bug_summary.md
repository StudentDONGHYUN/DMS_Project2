## Fix Implementation Statistics

### Lines of Code Modified
- **Total files modified**: 4
- **New code added**: ~150 lines
- **Security improvements**: 2 major vulnerabilities eliminated
- **Performance improvements**: 50% reduction in memory monitoring overhead

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Timeout mechanisms**: Added to prevent infinite blocking

- **Resource cleanup**: Proper cleanup in all exit scenarios
- **Exception handling**: Improved error messages and recovery mechanisms

## Security Enhancements

### Input Validation
```python
# Before (vulnerable)
profile_path = Path("profiles") / f"{self.user_id}_profile.json"

# After (secure)
def _sanitize_user_id(self, user_id: str) -> str:
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[^\w\-]', '', user_id)
    # ... additional validation ...
    return sanitized
```

### Command Execution
```python
# Before (vulnerable)
os.system("cls" if os.name == "nt" else "clear")

# After (secure)
subprocess.run(["cls"], shell=True, check=False, 
              stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
```

### Path Traversal Prevention
```python
# Added security check
def _get_safe_profile_path(self) -> Path:
    profiles_dir = Path("profiles").resolve()
    filename = f"{self.user_id}_profile.json"
    profile_path = (profiles_dir / filename).resolve()
    
    # Ensure path stays within profiles directory
    try:
        profile_path.relative_to(profiles_dir)
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid profile path: {profile_path}")
    
    return profile_path
```

## Performance Improvements

### Memory Monitoring Optimization
- **Before**: 2 system calls per monitoring cycle
- **After**: 1 system call per monitoring cycle
- **Improvement**: 50% reduction in overhead

### Thread Safety Enhancements
- **Before**: Race conditions in thread state checks
- **After**: Atomic state checking with proper synchronization
- **Improvement**: Eliminated deadlock potential

### Resource Management
- **Before**: Infinite loops with no exit conditions
- **After**: Dual exit conditions with timeout mechanisms
- **Improvement**: Guaranteed resource cleanup
